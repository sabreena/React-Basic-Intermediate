# Task

The state for our todos should be stored in local storage so when we come back to the page at a later time all our data is still there
Convert all the state in the application to use useReducer and Context to pass the state between components
Add the ability to delete existing todos
Add a form that lets you filter todos by their name and hide completed todos

# Bonus
Add the ability to edit existing todos
This is in the bonus section not because the editing portion is tricky, but because handling the proper UI state of swapping between text and an input is something we haven't really done before
